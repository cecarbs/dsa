PreOrder
-root
-left
-right

1. Logic first
2. Recurse on left
3. Recurse on right


PostOrder
-left
-right
-root

1. Recurse on children first
2. Perform logic on current node

NOTE:
- No logic is done until we reach leaf node since calling children takes priority
- Root is the last node where logic is done


InOrder
-left
-root
-right

1. Recurse on left child
2. Perform logic on current node
3. Recurse on right child

NOTE:
- No logic is done until node without left child since calling on left child takes priority over logic

IMPORTANT: Type of DFS doesn't matter in most problems
